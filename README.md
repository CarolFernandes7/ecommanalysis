# ecommanalysis


## Project Overview

This project simulates an e-commerce data analysis, focusing on key metrics such as **Conversion Rate (CVR)** and **Net Revenue per Session (NRPS)**. The goal of this analysis is to evaluate the performance of two platforms: the website and the mobile app, in terms of user behavior and revenue generation.

## Key Metrics

- **Conversion Rate (CVR)**: Measures the percentage of user sessions that resulted in a purchase.
- **Net Revenue per Session (NRPS)**: Calculates the average revenue generated per session on each platform.

## Data Analysis and Visualizations

1. **Data Simulation**: 
   A simulated dataset was used to represent user sessions, purchases, and revenue on both platforms (website and mobile app).

2. **KPI Calculations**:
   - CVR was calculated by dividing the number of purchase sessions by the total number of sessions for each platform.
   - NRPS was calculated by dividing the total revenue by the number of sessions for each platform.

3. **Visualizations**:
   - Bar charts were created to visually compare the performance of the website and mobile app in terms of CVR and NRPS.
   - A table summarizing the dataset was also generated for easier presentation in reports or presentations.

## Key Insights

- The **mobile app** had a higher conversion rate compared to the **website**, indicating that users on the app were more likely to make purchases.
- However, the **website** generated more revenue per session, suggesting that while fewer purchases were made, the order value was higher.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: For data analysis and calculations.
- **Matplotlib**: For creating visualizations of the key metrics.
- **Pandas**: For managing and manipulating the data.
